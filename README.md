# JUCE-OSC2MIDI

Install JUCE w Projucer and Unzip file. Open .jucer file to open Projucer (select app to open with if not). Build a solution using Projucer by opening your IDE with the "OPEN in IDE" button at the top of Projucer app. Lots of bugs with this yet but the idea is to eventually convert to plugin and develop standalone/plugin that can run on Mac/PC to act as device bridge for Patchworld.
